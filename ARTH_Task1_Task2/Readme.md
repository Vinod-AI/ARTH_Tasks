✴️ Setup a Hadoop cluster with one NameNode(Master) and 4 DataNodes(Slave) and one Client Node.

✴️ Upload a file through client to the NameNode.

✴️ Check which DataNode the Master chooses to store the file.

✴️ Once uploaded try to read the file through Client using the cat command and while Master is trying to 
access the file from that DataNode where it stored the file delete that DataNode  or crash it and see with
help of the replicated storage how master retrieves the file and present it to client.
